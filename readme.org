This package provides two interactive commands that make commenting
and uncommenting text in ~latex-mode~ a bit smarter and, of course, as
automated as possible.  Here are the two docstrings

#+begin_example
This package defines two interactive commands.

The command `latex-smart-comment-dwim' has four cases:

  1) region is not active, and
     point is not in a comment, and
     point is at the end of the line, or there is only whitespace
     between point and the end of the line;

  2) region is not active, and
     point is not in a comment;

  3) region is not active;

  4) region is active.

In case 1), `comment-dwim' is called, which will insert an inline
comment.  In case 2), the line where point is on is commented.
In case 3), the current line is uncommented.  In case 4),
`latex-smart-comment-do-region' is called on the active region.

`latex-smart-comment-do-region' also works on a discontinuous
region (such that the return value of `region-bounds' contains more
than one cons cell), and throws an error in four cases:

  1) the region is not active;

  2) the continuous region is neither fully commented nor
     uncommented;

  3) the discontinous region either contains a section that
     violates condition 2);

  4) the sections of the discontinuous region are not either all
     commented or all uncommented.

When all these conditions are met, the effect of this command is
to change the status of the region: if it's commented, it
uncomments it; if it is uncommented, it comments it.
